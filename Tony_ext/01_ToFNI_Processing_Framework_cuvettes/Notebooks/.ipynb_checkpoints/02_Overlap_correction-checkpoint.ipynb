    "This notebook gives the overlap corrected images and the images with averaged pulses. After this process, the image post processing should be applied to get the transmission image.\n",

    "## IMPORTANT\n",
    "This is valid for the experiments ordered for the `scrubbing` correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**check any of the ShutterCount.txt files in the experiment to know the neutron count. Do not forget to modify it**\n",

    "### General notebook concept\n",
    "The general concept of this notebook is to perform the overlap correction and the averaging of the experiments as shown in the figure."
